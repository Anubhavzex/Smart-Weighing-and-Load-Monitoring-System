This project is a Smart Weighing and Load Monitoring System using


This project is a Smart Weighing and Load Monitoring System using an HX711 load cell amplifier, an OLED display (SSD1306), and a relay module, controlled through an ESP32 microcontroller. It is designed to accurately measure weight in multiple units (kg, g, lb) and track peak loads over time.
